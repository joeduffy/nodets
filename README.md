# nodets

A library of helper routines to make Node.js in TypeScript easier and more enjoyable.

I wish I could say there's a rhyme or reason to the specific set of helpers included here, however there isn't.  It's
basically a collection of stuff I've written after having to deal with certain recurring patterns over time.
